# Visual data analysis

Data are "seeds.csv" and "wholesale_customers_data.csv", which are two classification datasets from UCI.

This project concern visualization and analysis of high-dimensional data. 

I create different functions in Python and use  Kmeans and DBSCAN on datasets, which are two common clustering algorithms in unsupervised machine learning; analyze distributions for all variables before and after clustering; reduce dimensions with PCA and also visualize datasets in 2D with t-SNE or UMAP.
